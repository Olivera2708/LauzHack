# Frontend Template

This is the base React application used for code generation.
It is built with:
- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

## Structure

- `src/components/ui`: Contains pre-installed shadcn/ui components.
- `src/lib/utils.ts`: Utility functions for Tailwind class merging.
- `src/App.tsx`: Entry point (will be overwritten or modified by generator).

## Usage

The backend should copy this directory to a target location before generating new components into `src/`.
